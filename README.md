# Eye Rest Reminder Python project

A smart desktop app that helps computer users follow the 20-20-20 rule to reduce eye strain — built with Python, OpenCV, and CustomTkinter.

# Overview

Spending long hours in front of screens can cause digital eye strain.
The 20-20-20 rule suggests taking a 20-second break to look at something 20 feet away every 20 minutes.

This application automates that rule — reminding you to take timely breaks, using AI-powered face detection to ensure reminders only appear when you’re actually using the computer.

# Features

😊 Automated Eye Rest Reminders — Triggers desktop notifications after every timer cycle.
😊 Real-time Face Detection — Uses OpenCV to detect your presence and intelligently reset timers when you step away.
😊 Modern & Minimal UI — Built with CustomTkinter for a sleek, dark-themed look.
😊 Smart Timer with Countdown — Displays active timer and break countdown on the screen.
😊 Threaded Execution — Runs webcam feed, timers, and UI updates concurrently for smooth performance.
😊 Cross-Platform Notifications — Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (via plyer).
